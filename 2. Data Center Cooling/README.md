Inspired by [DeepMind's realization](https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-ai-reduces-google-data-centre-cooling-bill-40/)

This repository hold the development of a business question that can be solved with Reinforcement Learning : cooling data centers
- The environment modelled with the fashion of OpenAI Gym's environments
- Solving the problem with different RL algorithms (Q-Learning, Deep-Q-Learning, Policy Gradients)
- A interactive Dash app to test the environment and the agents


***
## Data Center Cooling environment

To try out the app, launch with ``python app.py`` and go to port ``localhost:8050``
