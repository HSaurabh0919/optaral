# Discrete Optimization


- The goal of optimization is to find the optimal or a least a high quality solution in a reasonable amount of time even when we face exponential growth in the number of possible solutions


## How to solve an optimization problem ?
- Formalization of the mathematical model
- Start with a greedy algorithm


## Formalizing an optimization task
**How to model an optimization problem?**<br>
Agreeing on a mathematical form on the problem.
- Choose some decision variables (typically encode the result we are interested in)
- Express the problem constraint in terms of variables (what the solutions to the problem are)
- Express the objective function to be maximized (specifying the quality of a solution)

> There can be many ways to model an optimization problem
