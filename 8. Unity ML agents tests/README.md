# Unity ML Agents test

> I've been creating environments directly with Python for a few years now, yet I've been facing lots of limitation due to the nature of Python<br>
> In 2020, the best option is probably Unity ML Agents. 
> This repo will hold experiments on custom Unity environments/games and Reinforcement Learning to attempt solving them

## Rolling a ball (January 2020)
![](rolling_a_ball/rollingaball1.png)
> My first experiment is a simple game about rolling a ball affected by gravity trying to catch all 10 pickups randomly placed in the environment. Movement is directly affected by inertia. To create the same env, follow Unity official tutorial https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball-tutorial
